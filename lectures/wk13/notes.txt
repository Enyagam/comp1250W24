Error Handling
    Steps to take in case something goes wrong in your code
    How can something go wrong:
        Ask for user input
        Attempt to open a resource (file, database, etc)
        Attempt to convert

Error Handling does not help with syntax errors
    Syntax, Logical, Runtime
    Logical error: math : equation (1 + 3) / 2
    Runtime: forget to convert, looping issue

How to handle errors
    When you have code that MAY result in an error,
    wrap the code in try-except blocks
    try block => code that MAY result in an error
        user input, conversion, open a resource
    except block: what steps/actions to take if the try block
    statements result in an error

Different Types of Errors
    TypeError
        data types
    ValueError
        expected value
    IndexError
        index of a collection (list, tuples, etc)
    KeyError
        dictionary keys

Finally statement
    runs every time, whether or not there's an error
Else statement
    runs only of there is no error
